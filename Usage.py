  Downloads an IAST agent that communicates with ASoC.  
  The IAST agent communicates with ASoC using an agent key, unique to every IAST scan.
  This agent key is automatically embedded inside the downloaded IAST agent. 
   
  Each IAST agent is associated with a single IAST scan, which is configured in a application in ASoC.
  It is possible to connect multiple agents to a single IAST scan. 
  Based on user input, the script can perform the following actions:
  * Associate the IAST agent with an existing scan.
  * Create a new scan for the IAST agent, associated to an existing application.
  * Create a new application and a new scan for the IAST agent.
